def parseProperty(property_filename):

    '''
        Parses a property file using regular expressions
        Replaces occurrences of x?? (where ?? are digits) by x[??]
        Replaces occurrences of y?? (where ?? are digits) by y[??]
        (for convenience of evaluating the expression with python's parser)
        Returns:
             two dictionaries: equations amd bounds
                each dictionary has as keys the type (type2) of property: 'x','y','m',(mixed),'ws'
                values are lists of properties of the appropriate type
                    e.g., bounds['x'] is a list of bounds on input variables, where x?? has ben replaced by x[??]

             a list of all properties, given as a list of tuples of strings: (type1,type2,property,index)
                where:
                    type1 is 'e' (equation) or 'b' (bound)
                    type2 is 'x','y','ws', or 'm' (for 'mixed'),
                    property is a line from the property file (unchanged)
                    index is the index of a bound/equation in the appropriate list
